Two-Player Real-Time Battleship web app using React.
- [ ] player either signs up or logs in
  - [ ] upon login, player arrives at Lobby
    - Lobby has:
      - [ ] list of friends who are currently logged in
      - [ ] 
- [ ] players should choose ship positions
  - Layout
    - [ ] basic board
    - [ ] list of ships next to it
  - [ ] clicking on ship type sets active ship for placement
  - [ ] hovering over board with active ship causes certain squares to change color
    - [ ] hovering over a square with a ship that's already placed causes hovering to change to red
      - [ ] don't allow placement of ship overlapping another ship
    - [ ] have toggle button for vertical/horizontal placement
  - [ ] clicking on square with active ship places the ship on the board
  - [ ] clicking on a placed ship should allow you to reposition the ship
    - should pointer be at end of ship, or "square" of ship that was clicked?
  - [ ] when all ships are placed, ask player to confirm ship placements (ready to play)

- [x] convert Board component to generic Board just with styling
  - [x] consider switching where letters and numbers go
  - [x] add a GameBoard component wrapper to Board which adds shooting functionality
  - [ ] add a PlacementBoard component wrapper to Board which lets player place ships
    - [ ] both of these wrappers need a way to tell which square was clicked
